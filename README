duo_unix - Duo two-factor authentication for Unix systems

Duo provides simple two-factor authentication as a service via:

    1.  Phone callback
    2.  SMS-delivered one-time passcodes
    3.  Duo mobile app to generate one-time passcodes
    4.  Duo mobile app for smartphone push authentication
    5.  Duo hardware token to generate one-time passcodes (legacy)

This package allows an admin (or ordinary user) to quickly add Duo
authentication to any Unix login without setting up secondary user
accounts, directory synchronization, servers, or hardware.

What's here:

lib
	Simple C API for the Duo two-factor authentication service.

login_duo
	Login utility to add secondary Duo authentication to any login
	(e.g. via sshd ForceCommand or ~/.ssh/authorized_keys command)
	to augment password, pubkey, or other primary auth method.

pam_duo
	Optional Pluggable Authentication Module for Linux, FreeBSD,
	NetBSD, MacOS X, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX to add Duo authentication
	system-wide (e.g. sshd, sudo, su, samba, etc.)

Build
-----

Build dependencies for libduo (install these first!):

OpenSSL
	OpenSSL (http://openssl.org) development headers and libraries
	are installed by default on *BSD and MacOS X.

	Solaris, HP-UX, AIX:	3rd party packages or source build
	Redhat/Fedora/CentOS:	yum install openssl-devel
	Debian/Ubuntu: 		apt-get install libssl-dev

libcurl
	The curl (http://curl.haxx.se) development headers and library
	are installed by default on MacOS X, and require OpenSSL.

	FreeBSD/NetBSD:		www/curl port or package
	Solaris, HP-UX, AIX	3rd party packages or source build
	Redhat/Fedora/CentOS:	yum install curl-devel
	Debian/Ubuntu:		apt-get install libcurl-dev 
				(use the openssl version)

Build dependencies for pam_duo:

libpam
	System PAM development headers and libraries are installed by
	default on FreeBSD, NetBSD, MacOS X, Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX.

	RedHat/Fedora/CentOS:	yum install pam-devel
	Debian/Ubuntu:		apt-get install libpam-dev

Options to ./configure:

--with-libcurl=DIR
	Specify location of libcurl build or install directory
	(e.g. "/usr/local", "/opt/csw"), if not installed in a system
	location (e.g. /usr/lib).

--with-pam[=DIR]
	Build PAM module, and optionally override the default install
	directory (determined automatically by platform) if necessary.

--with-privsep-user=USER
	Specify a different user for privilege separation (e.g. "_duo")
	in login_duo - by default, "sshd" (or "_sshd" on MacOS X).

NOTE: If you're missing ./configure you accidentally downloaded the
git source tree tarball. Get a versioned package tarball instead:

	https://github.com/duosecurity/duo_unix/downloads

Then just run "make".

Install
-------

"make install" as root should do it.

The pam_duo module will be installed in the system PAM module location
by default (/lib/security, /usr/lib/security, /usr/lib/pam, /usr/lib
depending on platform).

login_duo will be installed setuid root by default in order to keep
your Duo credentials (ikey/skey) in /etc/duo/login_duo.conf secret. It
may also be installed non-setuid manually, such as for a user
installation with an individual (not system-wide) configuration file.

Add your Duo integration and secret keys to /etc/duo/login_duo.conf ;
for PAM, you'll need to create /etc/duo/pam_duo.conf manually.

Test
----

To test your Duo configuration, run login_duo from the command line as
your target user - for the default setuid-root install:

	$ login_duo echo YOU ROCK

For a non-setuid install:

	$ ./login_duo -c login_duo.conf echo YOU ROCK

If your Duo integration and secret keys are valid, you will be able to
enroll and authenticate successfully, and congratulate yourself. :-)

Usage
-----

See README.pam, README.ssh, and the login_duo.8 and pam_duo.8 manpages
for detailed setup instructions.

To build C applications with libduo, use "pkg-config libduo" with
--cflags and --libs arguments to locate the development headers and
library. See the duo.3 manpage for API documentation.

Eval users (e-mail <duo_unix@duosecurity.com> to request a trial):
be sure your Duo API host is set to "api-eval.duosecurity.com"
