duo_unix - Duo two-factor authentication for Unix systems

This package allows an admin (or even an ordinary user) to quickly set
up two-factor authentication for login - without setting up user
accounts, directory synchronization, servers, hardware, etc.

You'll need to create a Duo account first (for now, e-mail
duo_unix@duosecurity.com for access), and configure your Duo API host
as api-eval.duosecurity.com.

What's here:

lib
	Simple C API for the Duo two-factor authentication service.

login_duo
	Login utility to add secondary Duo authentication to any login
	session (e.g. for SSH, ForceCommand in sshd_config or a forced
	command in authorized_keys to follow any password, pubkey, or
	other auth method).

pam_duo
	Pluggable Authentication Module for Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
	MacOS X, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX to add Duo authentication
	system-wide (e.g. sshd, sudo, su, samba, etc.)

Build
-----

Build dependencies for libduo (install these first!):

OpenSSL
	OpenSSL (http://openssl.org) development headers and libraries
	are installed by default on *BSD and MacOS X.

	Solaris, HP-UX, AIX:	3rd party packages or source build
	Redhat/Fedora/CentOS:	yum install openssl-devel
	Debian/Ubuntu: 		apt-get install libssl-dev

libcurl
	The curl (http://curl.haxx.se) development headers and library
	are installed by default on MacOS X, and require OpenSSL.

	FreeBSD/NetBSD:		www/curl port or package
	Solaris, HP-UX, AIX	3rd party packages or source build
	Redhat/Fedora/CentOS:	yum install curl-devel
	Debian/Ubuntu:		apt-get install libcurl-dev 
				(use the openssl version)

Build dependencies for pam_duo:

libpam
	System PAM development headers and libraries are installed by
	default on FreeBSD, NetBSD, MacOS X, Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX.

	RedHat/Fedora/CentOS:	yum install pam-devel
	Debian/Ubuntu:		apt-get install libpam-dev

Options to ./configure:

--with-curl=DIR
	Specify location of libcurl build or install directory
	(e.g. "/usr/local", "/opt/csw"), if not installed in a system
	location (e.g. /usr/lib).

--with-pam[=DIR]
	Build PAM module, and optionally override the default install
	directory (determined automatically by platform) if necessary.

--with-privsep-user=USER
	Specify a different user for privilege separation (e.g. "_duo")
	in login_duo - by default, "sshd" (or "_sshd" on MacOS X).

Install
-------

"make install" as root should do it.

The pam_duo module will be installed in the system PAM module location
by default (/lib/security, /usr/lib/security, /usr/lib/pam, /usr/lib
depending on platform).

login_duo will be installed setuid root by default in order to keep
the Duo service credentials (ikey/skey) in login_duo.conf secret. It
may also be installed non-setuid, such as for a user installation with
an individual (not system-wide) configuration file.

Usage
-----

See README.pam, README.ssh, and the login_duo.8 and pam_duo.8 manpages
for detailed setup instructions.

To build C applications with libduo, use "pkg-config libduo" with
--cflags and --libs arguments to locate the development headers and
library. See the duo.3 manpage for API documentation.
